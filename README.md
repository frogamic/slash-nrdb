Search for Netrunner cards from within the comfort of Slack.

## Setup
- grab the Netrunner icons: https://github.com/MWDelaney/Netrunner-Icon-Font
- convert the SVGs into PNGs
- upload them as custom emoji in Slack

### Todo
- make custom emoji (#8b898f) to include inside this project
- provide mapping of images to emoji texts
- should the same server support POST and GET so that it can be used with webhooks?
